An increasing amount of research on the external financing of social enterprises stems from a fragmented body of the literature anchored in a variety of subject areas (e.g. entrepreneurship, public sector management, general management and strategy). We systematically review 204 academic articles published between 1998 and 2021 to bridge the knowledge gaps in these subject areas by: (1) mapping the field of the external financing of social enterprises at the individual, organisational and institutional levels; (2) synthesising the findings to develop an overarching framework; and (3) discussing theoretically sound future research avenues. We find that research at the individual level focuses primarily on investors’ perspective of the ideal characteristics of a social entrepreneur. Research at the organisational level often addresses the dual logics of social enterprises and their impact on the successful financing of these businesses and the role of investor–investee collaboration. Research at the institutional level can be clustered into cultural, economic, political and legal factors. Overall, we stress the need for research that adopts an overarching view by considering all three levels of analysis simultaneously and using organisational and economic theories. © 2022 The Authors.

Several strategies are being developed to motivate and integrate SDGs and net zero-related approaches in companies, among which the circular economy (CE) is gaining momentum due to its documented impact on the elements of the SDGs and net zero. In fact, recent studies began to examine the relationship between CE, SDGs and net zero through different perspectives and with different areas of application. Although this relationship is primarily for the implementation of the SDGs and net zero targets, very few studies demonstrate concerns about CE-SDG-net zero relationships, specifically with smart CE. Although the traditional CE influences the SDGs and net zero positively, the traditional approach remains insufficient in several areas, including the lack of real-life information, where most CE practices and principles reside. To address this gap, a smart CE has been established by researchers to unleash the potential of achieving SDGs and net zero. To explore the smart CE and to tackle the existing literature gap, this study focuses on identifying the influence of smart CE with a focus on achieving SDGs and net zero with a single textile case study. The study is divided with four phases, as follows. The first phase attempts to select the best and most feasible CE practices that have a major impact on SDGs and net zero. The second phase understands the smart integrated success factors for adopting selected CE practices. The third phase evaluates and analyzes the overall common success factors for selected CE practices, and finally, the fourth phase validates the available results from the previous phases through feedback from various reliable sources. A case study methodology has been used in this study to understand the core of the research, while it should be noted this study is groundbreaking work in the field of research. Two different multi-criteria decision-making tools (MCDMs) have been used, namely the Best Worst Method (BWM) and the grey DEMATEL for selecting the best and most feasible CE practices and for evaluating the commonly collected success factors. Two theories (CSF theory and TOE theory) have been used to strengthen the study's theoretical background and contribution. To assist practitioners, the available results are discussed in a way that understands the relationship between the chosen CE practices and their considered influential success factors with SDGs and net zero through digitalization. © 2023 The Author(s)","BWM; CE practices; CSF theory; Grey DEMATEL; Net zero; SDGs; Textile; TOE theory","Decision making; BAD methods; Best bad method; Circular economy; Circular economy practice; CSF theory; DEMATEL; Gray DEMATEL; Net zero; Sustainable development goal; TOE theory; Textiles"

However, management literature seems to privilege one of these paradigms at a time, neglecting their possible integration for business model innovation. This paper seeks to contribute to such literature gap by investigating the interplay between SE and CE and presenting a qualitative case study in the clothing recycle sector. By combining Gioia methodology and system dynamics, the study develops a research framework based on an interpretive, participative, and iterative approach.

We draw on existing insights regarding the Darwinian, Communitarian, and Missionary orientation of entrepreneurs and on interviews with 29 founders to develop our hypotheses, which we then test in a sample of 58 academic and 113 non-academic founders that participated in a venture competition. We argue that, compared to non-academic institutional logics, academic logics are tied to a stronger Communitarian and Missionary orientation and a weaker Darwinian orientation in founders. A stronger Darwinian orientation values venture growth, whereas a stronger Communitarian orientation appraises the benefit of the technology for a restricted set of people at the expense of such growth ambitions. A stronger Missionary orientation values welfare maximization for society which may to some degree entail higher growth aspirations. We argue and empirically confirm that these identity orientations explain why academic founders hold lower growth aspirations for their start-up than non-academic founders. Our findings can at least partially clarify why academic start-ups do not grow according to expectancies. They theoretically advance our insights in academic entrepreneurship and founders' growth aspirations while also extending the literature on founders' identity orientation. © 2022","Academic entrepreneurship; Commercialization; Economic development and growth; Emotion; Intention; Motivation; Technology transfer","Economic and social effects; Academic entrepreneurship; Commercialisation; Economic development; Economic growths; Emotion; Identity orientation; Institutional logic; Intention; Social groups; Welfare maximizations; Technology transfer"

Moreover, we propose a new way of operationalizing ambidexterity, under a holistic vision, including the synergies between exploration and exploitation. The study has been developed in the Spanish organic agro-food industry; a total of 239 usable responses were received from two respondents from each company—the general manager and the quality manager. The findings show that enabling formalization and organizational trust are positively related to ambidexterity, but contrary to our predictions, we found no evidence to show that coercive formalization is related to ambidexterity. In turn, we found different results for trust as a moderating factor on the types of formalization and ambidexterity. © The Author(s) 2020.","Ambidexterity; formalization; organic agro-food industry; organizational trust",""

However, a systematic approach regarding sustainability research through administrative efforts is still lacking in HEIs worldwide. Therefore, this manuscript aimed to explore contradictions embedded in the activity systems that hamper the internalization of sustainability research in HEIs. The current study conducted semi-structured interviews with faculty members at a leading research university in Taiwan. The lens of activity theory was used to explore and analyze tensions rooted in the activity systems involved in research and innovation. We found that resources to undertake sustainability-related research have not been allocated in a desirable manner. Moreover, the stakeholders are lacking agency, motivation, and perceived urgency to play their roles in supporting sustainability-related research through their practices. The propositions concluded from this study would help the involved actors to reconfigure their activity systems to make a contribution toward sustainability. This study also serves as a fundamental step towards conducting future empirical studies in contextual theory building directed at co-creating value through sustainability-related research and innovation practices. © 2022 by the authors.","activity theory; service-dominant logic; sustainability; value co-creation","Taiwan; higher education; institutional framework; questionnaire survey; stakeholder; sustainability; university sector"

Drawing on social exchange theory, this research extends corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature by investigating the positive effect of perceived CSR on employees’ pro-environmental behaviors and exploring the mediating mechanisms of environmental consciousness and environmental commitment between perceived CSR and employees’ pro-environmental behaviors. Survey data were collected from 301 employees working in the textile manufacturing industry of Pakistan. The findings of this study demonstrate a positive direct impact of perceived CSR on pro-environmental behaviors. Moreover, environmental consciousness and environmental commitment mediated this relationship. Taken together, this study indicates that perceived CSR has three paths to impact employee pro-environmental behavior: direct effect, indirect effect via environmental consciousness, and indirect effect via environmental commitment. The contributions of this study include supporting social exchange theory and presenting pioneering evidence of environmental consciousness and environmental commitment mediating processes between perceived CSR and pro-environmental behaviors.

It then empirically tested the effect of managerial value, with the moderation of organizational culture, on corporate social responsibility practice. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have devised a “moderated micro-macro model” type of multilevel model, wherein managerial value took the micro (individual level) predictor variable role, stakeholder-based corporate social responsibility practice the macro (organizational level) outcome variable role and organizational culture the macro level moderating variable role. Because they need the attention of inquiry, large manufacturing firms in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, with a sample size of 53, constituted the organizational level units. The recent performance of the firms against corporate social responsibility practice and organizational culture have been judged by 473 randomly chosen employees. Managerial value has been rated by randomly picked managers, numbered 253. Analytically, Croon and van Veldhoven’s multilevel analytical package and Mplus software suited the designed model. Findings: The study has revealed that managerial value, indeed, is a potential positive driver of CSR practice, the two managerial value dimensions demonstrated differential effects on corporate social responsibility practice and only one of the organizational culture dimensions, hierarchical culture, played a moderation role in managerial value – corporate social responsibility practice link.

In other words, the authors focus their discussion on the challenges that social innovators are facing in their endeavor of solving wicked social problems within an extreme institutional environment. This research is guided by the following question: How does an extreme institutional environment influence social innovation processes? Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research builds on the unique case of the Palestinian non-governmental organization (NGO) sector, a rarely studied context in organizational studies. The authors combine archival sources with 24 semi-structured interviews with Palestinian NGOs. Findings: The authors theorize three barriers that hinder social innovation in such contexts: institutional trap, effectiveness trap and sustainability trap. The authors also theorize five mechanisms through which these barriers influence each other dynamically: mingling, surviving, undermining, binding and reinforcing. Taken together, these barriers and mechanisms shed light on social innovation processes taking place within extreme institutional environments. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is the methodological design, based on an extreme single case-study which, on a bunch of features, is quite unique in the world. The authors argue that the results are all the same transferable to other relatively similar contexts. Practical implications: By theorizing the institutional barriers to social innovation in an extreme institutional context, the research thus sheds light on how social innovation could be sustained and stimulated in Palestine and other contexts that face similar institutional challenges. Social implications: From an engaged scholarship perspective, studying Palestine cannot be more relevant than today considering the turmoil in which Palestinians are. The research thus provides a deeper understanding of organizational and institutional dynamics with crucial social repercussions. Originality/value: The social innovation literature has overemphasized success stories to the detriment of the struggles that hinder social innovations in extreme institutional environments. By focusing on the barriers that social innovators experience in these contexts, the authors provide novel empirical insight. Furthermore, this study enriches the understanding of the institutional dynamics of social innovations by proposing a process model that elucidates how an extreme institutional context can influence social innovations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Extreme institutional environment; Fragile institutions; Palestine; Social entrepreneurship; Social innovation",""

Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual article that develops propositions about the relationship of institutional logics and income level with opportunity entrepreneurship. Findings: The authors suggest that high-income individuals are less impacted than low-income individuals by institutional logics that do not support opportunity entrepreneurship. More specifically, the positive effects of a national business system that reflects and replicates market logics within a society have a greater impact on the proclivity to pursue opportunity entrepreneurship of low-income individuals than those with high incomes. Social implications: Policymakers addressing poverty need to understand that examining the overall societal impact of institutions is not enough. Weak institutions have a disproportionately negative impact on low-income individuals. In addition to critical resources, the accessibility of market logics is key. Originality/value: This study is the first in the entrepreneurship domain to theorize how and why institutions matter more for low-income individuals. This occurs via two mechanisms: (1) market logic accessibility and (2) the degree to which institutionalized market logics decrease opportunity cost.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors first illustrate the context of Central American illegal migration to the USA from a transitional entrepreneurship perspective, the authors address the economic drivers of illegal migration from Central America, which results in marginalization in the USA. Second, the authors build a theoretical model that suggests that Central Americans can improve their entrepreneurial abilities through the entrepreneurial cognitive adjustment mechanism. Findings: Central Americans at risk of illegally migrating to the USA have high entrepreneurial aptitudes. Entrepreneurship can help them avoid the economic uncertainty that drives Central Americans to illegally migrate to the USA and become part of a marginalized community of undocumented immigrants. This conceptual paper introduces an entrepreneurial cognitive adjustment mechanism as a tool for Central Americans to reshape their personalities and increase their entrepreneurial abilities in their home countries. In particular, entrepreneurial intentions reshape the personality characteristics of individuals (in terms of high agreeableness and openness to experiences, as well as low neuroticism) through the entrepreneurial cognitive adjustment mechanism, which consists of reflective action in sensemaking, cognitive frameworks in pattern recognition and coping in positive affect. Originality/value: This paper studies Central Americans at risk of illegal migration using the lens of transitional entrepreneurship, which advances the understanding of the antecedents to marginalized immigrant communities in the USA and suggests a possible solution for this phenomenon. Besides, the authors build a cognitive mechanism to facilitate the transitional process starting from entrepreneurial intention to reshaping individuals' personality, which further opens individuals' minds to entrepreneurial opportunities. Since entrepreneurial intention applies the same way to all entrepreneurs, the authors' aim of constructing the entrepreneurial intention unfolding process will go beyond transitional entrepreneurship and contribute to intention-action knowledge generation (Donaldson et al., 2021). Moreover, the conceptual study contributes to public policy such that international and local agencies can better utilize resources and implement long-term solutions to the drivers of illegal migration from Central America to the USA. © 2023, Jorge Arteaga-Fonseca, Yi (Elaine) Zhang and Per Bylund.","Central America; Illegal migration; Transitional entrepreneurship; Undocumented migrants",""

Existing literature in this area has primarily focused on the potential applications of blockchain technology in construction but little attention is given to the barriers, impeding its adoption. This study fills this research gap by identifying the most significant barriers to adopting blockchain technology for India's sustainable construction industry. The collected data were analyzed via a two-stage PLS-SEM-artificial-neural-network (ANN) predictive analytical approach. In total, 722 construction stakeholder surveys were conducted, and the final model of barriers to adopting blockchain technology for sustainable construction was statistically validated. This study's findings suggest that significant organizational, technological, cultural, legal, security and government barriers limit the adoption of blockchain technology for sustainable construction in India. These findings also imply that effective legislative processes and economic incentives are crucial for ensuring blockchain technology integration into sustainable construction and for efficient implementation of practices. As a further step, a roadmap is developed to support decision-makers in overcoming these barriers in the short, medium, and long terms. Finally, multi-tiered strategies that construction mapping, sustainability, and integration should be adopted to ensure the successful integration of BT into sustainable construction practices in India. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial neural networks; Barriers; Blockchain technology; India; Partial least squares structural equation modeling; Sustainable construction","India; Construction industry; Decision making; Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Engineering education; Integration; Least squares approximations; Neural networks; Sustainable development; Barrier; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; India; Partial least square structural equation modeling; Partial least-squares; Roadmap; Structural equation models; Sustainable construction; Technology barriers; artificial neural network; construction industry; industrial practice; information and communication technology; least squares method; sustainability; technology adoption; Blockchain"

This involves innovation processes with a broad range of distinctive actors. Innovation intermediaries, such as universities and research institutes, are needed to support and accelerate the transfer of knowledge. Nevertheless, little is known about the influence of such actors on the configuration of the knowledge bases required for STs. This article presents insights from 14 semi-structured interviews with experts conducted in a regional innovation system (RIS) in East Germany. In cooperation with the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, we investigate four innovation intermediaries in the region of Eberswalde. The analytical framework links the concept of differentiated knowledge bases to small wins. Our results show that, first, in the Eberswalde region, the relevant actors involved in regional knowledge transfer focus predominantly on synthetic knowledge bases, such as experience-based knowledge of local area settings. Second, symbolic knowledge bases are crucial and often prerequisites for intermediary organizations to recombine knowledge bases and support the capability to innovate in regional knowledge transfer. Symbolic knowledge entails the ability to translate scientific findings to a language that can be understood by the various actors in knowledge transfer. Third, changes in organizational structures complement changes in cultural–cognitive and normative institutions to support innovation on a systemic level and foster change processes. © 2023, The Author(s).","D02; D80; Innovation intermediation; Knowledge bases; Knowledge transfer; O12; P48; Q56; R11; Small wins; Sustainability transition",""

This timely book takes an insightful look from a nonprofit sector perspective at how these changes are impacting accreditation of higher education institutions. Using empirical data on agencies within the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), Stefan Handke provides a thorough review of external assessments carried out by these agencies and reveals the transformation of nonprofit organisations with a public interest orientation into business-like organisations. The book further examines the negative impact on one of the most important functions of QA agencies: the creation of trust and how a change in the rules for external QA is required to alleviate this issue. Forward-thinking, the book also highlights the implications of these rule changes and the importance of them to ensure the survival of accreditation agencies. The expert analysis of the data within this book will be an invaluable resource for those working within QA agencies as well as stakeholders in higher education and researchers in the nonprofit sector.

The closest concept in the management of dual structures is the so-called organizational ambidexterity (OA). We refer to it as “Individual–Collective Organizational Ambidexterity”. Thus, it is necessary to explore factors affecting the OA of the IUEE's organizations to benefit simultaneously from individual and collective potentials and form successfully. To do so, a model was designed by examining the factors affecting the OA capacity of the IUEE's organizations. The statistical population was organizations involved in the IUEE of 36 cities in Kermanshah province, one of the poorest provinces in IRAN (N = 2041). Thus, 328 valid responses were collected as statistical sample based on the sampling table of Krejcie and Morgan (from 1970), and through the proportional stratified sampling method. The main instrument was a questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 26 and Smartpls3 software.

Thus, this work intends to identify those driving factors and establish their structural relationships to determine those factors with crucial roles in advancing research productivity. Due to the subjectivity of the identified driving factors and the notion that the evaluation of their relationships reflects an expert judgment, an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach and the Matrice d’impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment (MICMAC) analysis were adopted. Results show that institutional support, reward system, research funding, mentoring, and electronic information resources are the most crucial factors influencing research productivity. When addressed, these driving factors would motivate other driving factors, contributing to higher research productivity. In particular, these findings encourage higher education institutions to (1) efficiently allocate research funds and design mentoring programs, (2) offer efficient research incentive schemes, (3) develop initiatives that would support promising research proposals beneficial to the institution, and (4) collaborate with external organizations to grant funding for research proposals. These results contribute significantly to the literature as it provides meaningful insights that aid decision-makers in higher education institutions in resource allocation decisions, policy-making, and the design of efficient initiatives for augmenting their innovation potential. © 2022 by the authors.","driving factors; higher education institutions; interpretive structural modeling; MICMAC analysis; research productivity",""

Despite the growing increase in academic publications, IE still faces certain inconsistencies, with doubts remaining as regards its boundaries and the thematic groups making up the field. The purpose of this article is to systematically analyse the IE, mapping the intellectual territory and the evolution of the field. Design/methodology/approach: Indexed to Web of Science(WoS) database until 2021, from 52 journals, 130 articles were selected, applying content analyses techniques to identify the main research lines. Findings: The results reveal that IE presents four conceptual themes/clusters: (1) international business networks and opportunities; (2) institutional environments; (3) the characteristics and motivations of entrepreneurs; and (4) internationalisation drivers and processes. Extant analysis show that IE has progressed immensely, concentrating a good diversity of subtopics and research trends. An integrative framework bringing together 27 years of publications and 67 future research lines, detailed by cluster, were also presented in this study to improve understanding and guide future studies. Originality/value: This review makes a broad contribution to the IE literature, assisting in consolidating the academic field, expanding and complementing the results of previous theoretical–conceptual studies. We reflect and individually discuss the state of the art of the four streams that characterize IE to identify key themes, points of convergence and advance new subfields. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","International business; International entrepreneurship; Internationalisation; Systematic literature review",""

To address this issue, many organizations have embraced employee-driven participatory innovation to survive and thrive albeit the uncertainties. This study aims to investigate the role of enterprise social media (ESM) in supporting and facilitating these efforts. Design/methodology/approach: This study first identified the underlying mechanisms that allow ESM use to foster and maintain participatory innovation and then reexamined how these mechanisms played out during the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. The data was collected through a questionnaire in two phases, before and during work-from-home mandates, and the results were analyzed and compared to capture similarities and differences. Findings: The results revealed that innovation culture and management support mediated the effects of ESM use on three measures of innovation productivity in both conditions. Interestingly, the effect of ESM use was more prominent in driving innovation in the work-from-home condition. This effect was not limited to the direct effect of ESM use on innovation productivity but on innovation culture and management support as well. Originality/value: The results suggest that ESM offer a potentially useful path to support and enable employees to participate in the innovation processes, especially when they work remotely or in a distributed team. More generally, this paper should be of interest to researchers and practitioners interested in understanding, implementing and evaluating enterprise social software applications and encouraging employee-driven participatory innovation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Knowledge discovery; Organizational culture; Social media; Social networking",""

How can college students, who are often self-made and lack entrepreneurial experience, social capital, and resources, grow up to be “moral leaders” of social entrepreneurship organizations? And what role does social entrepreneurship education play? Previous studies have not provided corresponding theoretical explanations to address these questions. This study uses as examples two public welfare organizations and their founders; namely, YinChao Pension Service Center in Yinzhou District, Ningbo City, and Ant Public Welfare Service Center in Yuyao City. The exploratory comparative research method of two cases is used, and the perspective is constructed based on personal significance. Through the open decoding analysis, this study refines the key elements of the individual growth of public entrepreneurs as “moral leaders,” including four stages: concept construction, moral conflict, relationship construction, and rule construction, as well as personal meaning construction strategy and public entrepreneurship education strategy. The research results not only explain how individuals grow up to be “moral leaders” in public welfare organizations through self-meaning construction in the context of public welfare entrepreneurship and the construction process from individual to organization morality systems but also provide a theoretical framework for cultivating successful public welfare entrepreneurs and a theoretical reference for the sustainable development of public welfare entrepreneurs and public welfare entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities.

Performance-based budgeting is being adopted in organisations to allocate resources more efficiently, and Chinese public universities are no exception. The present study explicitly aimed to examine the relationship among staff capacity, performance-based budgeting, and organisational performance in Chinese public universities. It also investigated the role of top management support as a moderator. A purposive sampling method was used to select a total of 271 participants who agreed to participate in an online survey. A multimethod approach combining partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), the PROCESS macro and necessary condition analysis (NCA) was adopted. The PLS-SEM results indicated that performance-based budgeting had a positive relationship with university performance and served as a mediator between staff capacity and university performance. The moderated mediation results showed that top management moderated the relationship among the selected variables. The NCA results suggested that both staff capacity and performance-based budgeting are meaningful and significant necessary conditions for university performance. The combined results indicated how researchers and practitioners can identify the factors that are critical for university performance and result in the best possible outcomes. This is possibly the first study to use this multimethod approach in accounting research.

However, research has still not answered the key question regarding the dimensions of big poverty data analytics (BPDA) capabilities for creative service offerings nor their effects on economic and social outcomes. This study fills this gap by conducting a two-phase Delphi study and two rounds of surveys focusing on a globally leading microcredit institute in a developing country. The study conceptualizes management (analytics climate, cross-functional integration), platform (technology and data), and talent (pattern spotting and market ambidexterity) capabilities as the dimensions of BPDA capability. It further investigates creative service offerings (meaningfulness and novelty) as the mediator between BPDA—new service performance (economic outcome from the firm's end) as well as BPDA—quality of life (social outcome from consumer's end). Our research advances, first, the microfoundational view of dynamic capability (DC) theory in the emerging data-driven innovation paradigm by specifically identifying the complementary and co-specialization attributes of six microfoundations (i.e., analytics climate, cross-functional integration, data, technology, pattern spotting, and ambidexterity). In addition to DC, our study extends social innovation literature by establishing the connection between the instrument (BPDA capability) and outcome view (quality of life) of social innovation to tackle grand challenges in the developing world. Finally, our study extends creativity theory by introducing creative service offerings as a mediator and highlighting its role in the novel and meaningful solutions to social problems. Overall, this study is a pioneer in conceptualizing and empirically validating a research model that uncovers the potentially complex nuances between BPDA capability-creative offerings and innovation outcomes to tackle the grand challenge of poverty.

Sociology examines the social actors' activities in society and social problems. Western Scholars have developed many social theories, which address the underlying causes such as social conflicts and inequalities, and many formal and informal social organizations are involved to minimize the challenges of inequalities. The study of social organizations is a relatively new phenomenon in sociology. Broadly its historical root can be traced from Greek civilization (Plato, Aristotle), and it has mostly flourished since the Enlightenment Era. However, empirical studies show that the scientific study of organizations began only from the 19th and 20th century. Among the scholars of these centuries, the contributions of Karl Marx, Ferdinand Tönnies, émile Durkheim, Ludwig Gumplovicz, Vilfredo Pareto, Max Weber, and Talcott Parsons are considered as pillars of sociology.

We posit that institutional conditions in configuration facilitate firms' adoption of sustainable HRM. Thus, we hypothesize a primary institutional configuration where institutional support, institutional quality, and institutional infrastructure combine to promote the adoption of sustainable HRM. We further propose alternative types of configurations conducive to the adoption of sustainable HRM by introducing two organizational conditions: strategic leadership support and resource slack. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis on data from 57 cases in China supports our hypotheses. We find that the combination of institutional conditions promotes the adoption of highly sustainable HRM, and the two alternative types provide functional substitutes for the primary type: (a) strategic leadership support substitutes for the combination of institutional support and institutional infrastructure, and (b) resource slack substitutes for institutional infrastructure.

The fsQCA results complement these outcomes by showing that low levels of survival capacity are related to low levels of bricolage and founders’ ties. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Bricolage; COVID-19 pandemic; Crisis; Firm survival; Owner-managed SMEs",""

The authors also examine the moderating role of national culture (uncertainty avoidance and in-group collectivism) and the level of family control and influence in fostering/hindering this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted among 1,143 family firms from twenty-eight countries. The authors developed and tested hypotheses through a fixed-effects regression analysis. Findings: The findings suggest that environmental dynamism has a positive effect on all three EO dimensions. Analysis reveals a positive moderating role of family control and influence and negative moderating roles of in-group collectivism and uncertainty avoidance. Practical implications: The findings imply that family firm managers should carefully interpret the influence of their national culture on family firm behavior. More specifically, family firms in dynamic environments should consider the importance of the national culture in which they are embedded. Those operating in high uncertainty avoidant and highly collectivist cultures should take proactive steps to cultivate a corporate entrepreneurial culture. On the other hand, the family should not undermine the effect of its control and influence. In dynamic environments, family control and influence may be a competitive advantage in reinforcing entrepreneurial orientation. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature on EO in family firms by expanding the previous research on the antecedents of EO and examining moderation effects of culture and family control and influence across a broad multi-country sample. In contrast with the common findings regarding the effect of family logic on EO, the study shows the strengthening role of family control and influence in the relationship between environmental dynamism and EO. The authors show that culture as an informal institution may also play a critical role in hindering/strengthening the relationship between environmental dynamism and EO. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Entrepreneurial orientation; Environmental dynamism; Family control and influence; Institutional theory; STEP project global consortium",""

In this study, we apply an experimental research method to analyse the concept of social entrepreneurship comprehensively. More specifically, we develop bibliometric analysis and web crawling techniques to gather information related to social entrepreneurship from Scopus and Wikipedia. We conduct a comparative network analysis of social entrepreneurship’s conceptual structure at academic and non-academic levels. This analysis has been performed considering scientific articles’ keywords and Wikipedia webpages’ co-occurrences, enabling us to identify four different thematic clusters in both cases. Moreover, plotting the centrality and density of each cluster on a bi-dimensional matrix, we have sketched a strategic diagram and provided the thematic evolution of this research topic, based on the level of interaction among clusters, and the degree of cohesion of keywords in each cluster. This paper represents one of the first attempts in the entrepreneurship literature to shed light on the conceptual boundaries of a research topic based on the analysis of both a scientific and an open-source knowledge database. Our results reveal similarities and discrepancies between those two different sources of knowledge, and outline avenues for future studies at the intersection between social entrepreneurship and the research domains of digital transformation, performance measurement, entrepreneurial ecosystems, and ethics. We also call for a further conceptualisation of social entrepreneurship in the face of the increasing complexity that characterises grand challenges. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bibliometric analysis; Grand challenges; Network analysis; Social entrepreneurship; Web crawling; Wikipedia",""

Empirical research on strategic sustainability is expected to provide guidance for needed dynamic transformation and sustainability. The reported research builds on a multi-case research of four German wine estates. The cases each represent a specific generic strategic grouping and distinct business models and are thereby suited to analyse sustainability by leaning on the concept of dynamic capabilities. Sustainability was examined as a strategic vehicle for innovation in the wine industry and a nuanced view of dynamic capabilities. Premium strategist turned out to strongly engage and profile in sustainability with aligned dynamic capabilities as a building block to generate premium products. Quality leadership also leverages product quality with comprehensive dynamic capabilities aiming for sustainability by building on size and a professional structure but less on environmental profiling. The price–value strategy approaches sustainability primarily from a market-based and circular economy view. Niche strategist’s dynamic capabilities in the analysed population illustrated an entrepreneurial and effectuation-based approach with specific dynamic capabilities fine-tuned to exploit market opportunities. The multi-case analyses thereby allowed us to identify strategy-specific and business-model-suiting capabilities. © 2023 by the author.","business model design; dynamic capabilities; effectuation; entrepreneurship; generic strategies; resource dependency; transformation","Germany; business development; design method; innovation; leadership; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; wine industry"

As of 2022, around 27 million people were registered as refugees with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). While some consider refugees to be a burden on their host countries, there is growing evidence that they make significant contributions to host countries’ economies, with rates of entrepreneurship higher than other migrant groups and host country nationals. To take stock of what is known about refugee entrepreneurship, this article undertakes a systematic review of the refugee entrepreneurship empirical literature. The systematic review provides insights into the factors which shape refugees’ initiation of, engagement in, and performance of entrepreneurial endeavors and identifies gaps and inconsistencies in the current refugee entrepreneurship literature. Based on these gaps and inconsistencies, a future research agenda is proposed. By taking stock of what is known and proposing a future research agenda, this review has scholarly implications for the academic advancement of refugee entrepreneurship. Additionally, this review has policy implications. By better understanding the field of refugee entrepreneurship and its social and economic benefits, government policy-makers will be better positioned to design responsive policies to support refugee entrepreneurs in establishing their entrepreneurial endeavors.

A diverse set of stakeholders have been analyzed when performing entrepreneurial discovery tasks on a digital platform ecosystem. A quantitative survey-based experimentation phase with 686 individuals was conducted in two moderate-innovation ecosystems—Greece and Spain—and two defined as innovation leaders—Scotland and the Netherlands—on the European Innovation Scoreboard. Based on structural equation models, the findings show that digital applications, including discovery tasks, facilitate entrepreneurial alertness regardless of the innovation ecosystem in which the user operates. Additionally, Kruskal-Wallis tests reinforce that the relationship between perceived quality of digital applications for discovery tasks and perceived entrepreneurial alertness remains significantly positive despite heterogeneity across stakeholders and innovation ecosystem. Through its psychological foundations, this work reveals how digital technologies alert any kind of individual to potential entrepreneurial opportunities. It thus contributes to research on digital economies by evaluating digital technologies’ potential to boost psychological starting drivers of any entrepreneurial endeavor across innovation ecosystem.

Correspondingly, in addition to attaching importance to improving college students’ entrepreneurial intention, college entrepreneurship education should pay attention to improving college students’ entrepreneurial calling. At present, there is insufficient research on the association between entrepreneurial role models and entrepreneurial calling. We aim to study the mechanism and boundary condition of the association between entrepreneurial role models and entrepreneurial calling. Methods: A longitudinal survey was distributed among 519 students from 16 colleges and universities in China. In the survey, the college students answered questions on entrepreneurial role models, entrepreneurial calling, entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control and entrepreneurial hands-on practice. Hierarchical regression was conducted, testing the association between entrepreneurial role models and entrepreneurial calling of college students, mediated by entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control and moderated by entrepreneurial hands-on practice. Results: Therefore, based on the social learning theory, the theory of planned behavior and the entrepreneurial event model, and by hierarchical regression of the data, this study confirmed that entrepreneurial role models were positively associated with college students’ entrepreneurial calling by partially mediating with entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control. Moreover, Entrepreneurial hands-on practice positively moderated not only the relationship between entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control and entrepreneurial calling, but also the mediating association of entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control between entrepreneurial role models and entrepreneurial calling. Discussion: This study not only enriches the theoretical research on entrepreneurial calling and entrepreneurial role models, but also provides valuable educational enlightenment for colleges and universities to improve the students’ entrepreneurial calling.

We argue that this model is important to explain how those at the bottom of the economic pyramid, who are often neglected, use FinTech innovations to create and run informal businesses. Our findings and model explain the dynamics between logics, actors, and mobile money at three levels: regulatory, payments infrastructure, and informal economy.

A better understanding of SFSC is attained when looking at it as alternative food networks structured around organizational relationships. Aiming toward a comprehensive conceptualization of SFSC, this paper presents the findings of a transnational empirical investigation of different cases in a search of their central and most typical features. Building upon the Community of Practice (CoP) concept, SFSC are conceptualized as co-creative processes and as constructed realities with their traits being shaped by the interaction of participating multiple-actors. The sample of this study involves nine CoPs which are located in different parts of Europe and which were studied through open space discussions (World Café) with the participation of the various actors involved in the chain from production to consumption, services, research and policy areas. The identification of the most typical and ubiquitous attributes of SFSC as they appear across different contexts is based on an exploratory analysis which defines the main frames of SFSC and identifies on their basis the pillars of the conceptualization of SFSC. These pillars are sharing, authenticity and sustainability, the first one referring to the relational aspect, the second referring to the commercialization process and the third relating to the rationale or underlying logic of SFSC. The identified pillars signify their competitive advantage because SFSC develop as dynamic alternative networks to conventional, large-scale food systems. It is envisaged that the suggested conceptualization of SFSC would contribute to a better understanding of SFSC and foster future research in this field.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore entrepreneurial sensemaking by non-business graduate students enrolled in a transdisciplinary entrepreneurship course. Design/methodology/approach: A single case study design was used to explore how seven nonbusiness graduate students in a transdisciplinary entrepreneurial leadership course made sense of entrepreneurial content relevant to their academic interests and career aspirations. Data were collected through direct observations, semi-structured interviews and the administration of an entrepreneurial leadership proclivity assessment tool. Findings: Through experiential learning intentionally centering entrepreneurship, graduate students acquire entrepreneurial knowledge in ways that enhance their agency and sense of empowerment without diluting or overriding their academic and/or professional intentions. Practical implications: Sensemaking is framed as a pedagogical resource for fostering the integration of entrepreneurial content in transdisciplinary graduate courses and experiences in ways that align with and support the academic interests and career aspirations of individual students. Originality/value: A novel entrepreneurial sensemaking approach to the integration of entrepreneurial content with transdisciplinary curricula that is directly responsive to calls for graduate education transformation is introduced. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agency; Entrepreneurship education; Graduate education; Sensemaking",""

Encouraging a minimum level of certainty in ambiguous environments characterized by risk taking is important. Aware of this importance, we analyze the influence of institutional factors on entrepreneurship development. Specifically, we analyze political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, a robust rule of law, the ease of starting a new business, and the ease of obtaining credit. We develop two models to explain the presence and absence of entrepreneurship. To do so, we apply qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to a sample of 48 countries using data sourced from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and the Global Innovation Index. The results show that the effect of institutional factors on the level of entrepreneurship varies according to the socioeconomic characteristics of each country. They suggest that a wide range of institutional configurations lead to the presence or absence of entrepreneurship. Although entrepreneurship can be found in unfavorable institutional environments, future research should examine how to formalize such environments as a standardized institutional configuration to shift from necessity to opportunity entrepreneurship. Achieving this shift is relevant for innovation and economic development. © 2021 The Author(s)","Credit; Economic development; Entrepreneurship; Government; Institutional theory; Regulation",""

Findings: The findings show that the typologies of innovation that significantly impact the aforementioned variables are standard innovation/tailor-made innovation, social innovation/commercial innovation and incremental innovation/breakthrough innovation. They also reveal that the modalities considerably impacted by innovation are deviance in reaction, procedural injustice, increase of hidden costs and negative effect on ethics-culture. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is original in that it can contribute to the research in the field of innovation, as it deals with its negative effects in terms of typologies, which are rarely processed in innovation research.

Over the past few years, a considerable number of publications have increased the level of knowledge in this field; however, on the other hand, it also has generated more complexity, literature dispersity and lack of complete understanding of the possible research avenues on SL. This paper aims to address this by complementing and building on previous qualitative and quantitative studies of SL by unveiling and exploring the landscape of the research field. This study differs from prior research in three main ways: (1) explores how the term SL evolved from the leadership theory, (2) explores the research streams that scholars have been conducting in the field by adopting a robust search string revised by specialists and considering a wide range of terms related to formal and informal leadership, as well as sustainability-related terms and (3) understands how the several leadership theories and styles are connected to sustainable development (SD) and corporate social responsibility (CSR). After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 1,813 well-cited papers published in top journals that directly tackle sustainability leadership were selected. This sample was then used for the bibliometric assessment based on the co-occurrence of terms technique.

It presents a macro and micro analysis of workplace innovation in the Australian public sector written by a combination of practitioners and academics to provide both theoretical and practical insights. The book reviews the relationship between culture and workplace innovation as a multi- dimensional, subjective and context- specific phenomenon operating dynamically as organisational innovation, organisational climate for innovation, team and individual innovation. It identifies a variance in the perception of workplace innovation and organisational culture between public sector employees with different demographic and employment characteristics. The demographic and employment characteristics confirm that employees in a Public Sector Department of State exhibit significant differences between various groups in how culture impacts on workplace innovation. This knowledge assists practitioners in developing positive cultural environments that support the development of workplace innovation and raise awareness in considering the differences within organisations caused by an individual's characteristics. Lastly, the book reviews public organisations around the world and provides a cross- cultural comparison of public sector innovation and leadership. This includes a review of the major forms of public sector systems in operation and how this relates to innovation and leadership.

We use these different lenses to make sense of the ways CoPs are conceptualized and to review scholarly work on this topic.

Using a relational perspective to better account for the complexity of the institutional environment, we examine the following questions in the context of esports: how do organizations’ ties to different entities across the field affect the adoption of innovations in sport? And how are these relationships shaped by organizational status? Research methods: Our sample includes 1274 universities and colleges in the U.S. We used event history analysis to investigate the influence of ties to field-level interest associations (i.e. athletic associations) and local-level peer networks (i.e. athletic conferences, state community settings) on organizational adoption of collegiate varsity esports programs. We also examined the moderating role of organizational status (i.e. university/college ranking). With respect to model selection, we used the Cox proportional hazard model. Results and findings: Results show that interest associations and local peer networks have a significant effect on the establishment of varsity esports programs. Additionally, organizational status moderates the influence of different relational ties (i.e. interest associations and peers) on esports adoption.

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether firms may want to hire managers with a good fit when faced with institutional constraints and the authors suggest managerial level of education and experience within an industry could play a vital role in helping such firms innovate. Design/methodology/approach: Secondary data was obtained from the World Bank Enterprise Survey on 17 African countries and a series of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to achieve the aim of the research. Findings: The findings show that while managers with primary and secondary education had a negative relationship with firm innovation (product and process), managers with a university degree had a positive relationship. This relationship was also confirmed when the authors’ split the full sample into two sub-samples (the firms that are institutionally constrained by access to finance and corruption) and therefore confirm the institutional implications of managers fit for firm’s innovation.

This paper aims to investigate how the socio-cultural context influences women's entrepreneurship as women engage in “family entrepreneuring”. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on an inductive qualitative approach to explore how multiple cultural, social and economic contexts encourage women's entrepreneurship and, thus, position them at the centre of family entrepreneuring within this community. Using snowballing techniques, we analyse narratives from 51 women entrepreneurs, generated through semi-structured interviews, to reveal key insights into the practice of family entrepreneuring. Findings: The findings reveal the complex socio-cultural context within the “Adja” community, where polygamy, a traditional and cultural practice, enables the transfer of culturally and socially embedded informal knowledge. The study explains how women's entrepreneuring activities are supported by informal in-family apprenticeships, resulting in family members learning specific skills while also experiencing the feeling of belonging to the family. Showcasing the heterogeneity of contexts, particularly those found in Africa, this study challenges the normative view within the Global North and the dominance of the “heroic male” in entrepreneurship by showcasing how women (especially matriarchs) are significant actors in training other women, co-wives, daughters and relatives in family entrepreneuring. Originality/value: Thus, this study contributes to the extant literature on family entrepreneuring by revealing an unusual case of women from polygamous families becoming the focal actors in family entrepreneuring activity and challenging the culturally ascribed gender roles to evolve into the breadwinners in their households, as well as focusing on how this process is driven by endogenous knowledge exchange. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Africa; Culture; Endogenous knowledge; Family entrepreneuring; Polygamy; Women entrepreneurship",""

Design/methodology/approach: This paper qualitatively explores the Thai education and skill-formation system and conducts a cross-case analysis of four firms across different industries in Thailand. The empirical findings in this paper draws on semi-structured interviews with various stakeholders; field visits to vocational colleges, universities, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) and firms across industries both in Bangkok and in other provinces in Thailand; and a review of archival documents and web-based reports and resources. Findings: This paper proposes that firms across industries in Thailand must be responsible for helping their employees/workers obtain the green knowledge and skills necessary to perform green jobs through high-road human resource (HR) practices in response to the fact that the Thai education and skill-formation system is unlikely to produce a sufficient number of employees/workers who have green knowledge, skills and abilities and are industry-ready to perform green jobs, leading to a shortage of employees/workers who possess green skills in the labor market. Specifically, curricula in vocational colleges and universities in Thailand are not likely to respond to the needs of firms in producing those employees/workers. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research concern its methodology. This research is based on the qualitative studies of the Thai education and skill-formation system and a case study of firms across industries in Thailand. Thus, this paper does not aim to generalize the findings to all other countries but to enrich the discussion on the effects of macro-level HR policies on the creation of green jobs and the development of green skills across firms in each country. Additionally, it is difficult to gain access to firms across several industries and various stakeholders to understand the development of green skills among employees in these firms. The reasons are resource constraints, time constraints and the hesitation of firms in permitting the author to access the data. These difficulties have restricted the sources of information to construct a more nuanced picture of firms across various industries in developing green skills among their existing employees. Consequently, this research does not include firms in several other industries, including the pulp and paper industry, textile and garment industry, plastic industry and agri-food industry. Thus, future research may extend the topic of the development of green skills among employees to these industries. Quantitative studies using large samples of firms across industries may also be useful in deepening the understanding of this topic, which is significant from the perspectives of the strategic human resource management (SHRM), comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices, and green economy. Practical implications: This paper also provides practical implications for top managers and/or HR managers of firms in Thailand, other developing countries and other emerging market economies with deficiencies in the national education and skill-formation system. First, the top managers and/or HR managers can apply various methods to internally develop managers and employees/workers with the appropriate environmental/green knowledge and necessary skills to perform green jobs. The methods include classroom training, on-the-job training, coaching, mentoring systems, job shadowing and being role models for younger generations of employees. Second, these top managers and/or HR managers can cooperate with vocational colleges and/or universities in their countries to design educational programs/curricula related to environmental/green management to be able to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for their firms. These managers can request for assistance from universities in their countries when their firms confront sophisticated questions/problems related to environmental/green management. In this regard, universities will have an opportunity to solve real environmental/green problems experienced by industries, while firms can appropriately and accurately solve environmental/green questions/problems. Third, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their firms to apply for certificates of green-/environmentally friendly products or carbon footprint labels from NGOs to foster a green image among firms' consumers. These applications require the firms to pay special attention to the cultivation of green awareness and the development of green skills among their employees. Fourth, these top managers and/or HR managers can encourage their employees to express green-/environmentally friendly behaviors as well as sufficiency-based consumption behaviors. In fact, these top managers and/or HR managers can foster their employees to reduce energy consumption, including electricity and water, to conserve these types of energy for young generations. Fifth, these top managers and/or HR managers can adopt and implement green human resource management (GHRM) practices consisting of green recruitment and selection, green training and development, green performance management, green pay and rewards and green employee relations in their firms to upgrade both the environmental and social performances of firms. Finally, these top managers and/or HR managers must take serious actions regarding the implementation of environmental/green management policies and practices within their firms in order to facilitate the movement of the country toward the bioeconomy, circular economy, and green economy (BCG economy). Social implications: This paper provides social/policy implications for the government, vocational colleges and universities in Thailand, other developing countries and emerging market economies where the skill shortage problem is still severe. First, the government of each country should incorporate green/environmental policies into the national education policy and the long-term strategic plan of the country. Second, the government should continuously implement such national policy and strategic plan by encouraging government agencies, vocational colleges, universities, firms and NGOs to cooperate in developing and offering environmental/green management educational programs/curricula to produce graduates with suitable qualifications for those firms. Third, the government should encourage vocational colleges and universities to equip their students with green skills to be industry-ready in a real working context. Fourth, to alleviate the skill shortage problem in the labor market, the government should foster firms, especially private sector firms, to focus on the upskilling and reskilling of their existing employees. With this action, their existing employees will have green skills, be able to effectively perform green jobs and become an important driver to help the country move toward the BCG economy. Fifth, the government of each country should encourage firms to develop green-/environmentally friendly products by offering them various types of incentives, including tax reductions or tax exemptions. Sixth, the government should encourage universities in the country to sign a memorandum of understanding with leading research institutes and world-class digital technology companies such that these institutes and/or companies admit high-potential university students to work as trainees/entry-level employees for a certain duration. This action can ultimately facilitate knowledge transfer from these institutes and/or companies to those university students who will finally return to work in their home country. Seventh, the government, especially the Ministry of Education, should encourage vocational colleges and universities to teach students in the environmental/green management program based on real case studies/problems found across firms. In this way, graduates should be industry-ready to perform green jobs. Finally, the government must pay serious attention to the implementation of environmental/green management policies across levels within the country so that the transition of the country toward the BCG economy will finally come true in the future. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the SHRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices, and the literature on the green economy and the development of green skills in firms in the following ways. First, this paper focuses on examining how the institutional context of Thailand shapes the development of green knowledge and skills among employees across firms in Thailand. In this regard, the paper aims to fill the gap in the literature on strategic HRM and comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices as proposed by Batt and Banerjee (2012) and Batt and Hermans (2012), who suggested that the literature on strategic HRM should go beyond the organizational context and examine how firms adopt and implement HR practices in response to the national institutional context. Second, the paper aims to extend the literature on the green economy regarding the roles played by institutional factors in shaping the development of green knowledge and skills across firms. Finally, strategic HRM, comparative institutional perspectives on HR strategies and practices and green economy studies have overlooked the under-researched country of Thailand. Most studies in these three areas focus more on developed countries. Thus, the findings of this paper should extend the literature on those areas regarding the development of green skills among employees across firms in response to the Thai institutional context. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cross-case analysis; Green skills; HR practices; Institutional context; National education and skill-formation system; Thailand",""

SMEs are at an early development stage, which means weaker institutional norms and successful paradigms, tending to suffer from exceptionally high failure rates because of many constraints, including a lack of resources and credit to access the core information. The higher the environmental uncertainty, the more likely that new start-ups rely on all kinds of social links for acquiring resources. As a critical ability to withstand and overcome obstacles, entrepreneurial resilience is an essential personal characteristic to ensure the sustainability of new ventures. The purpose of this study is to investigate the internal mechanism through which SME entrepreneurs' social capital affects entrepreneurial resilience. To reveal the internal mechanism, we propose a moderated and mediation model. Using survey data from SEM entrepreneurs in China, hierarchical regression analysis and bootstrapping model are adapted to test and verify mediation and moderation effects. The results show that social capital indeed positively influences entrepreneurial resilience directly and partly through the mediating effect of harmonious entrepreneurial passion and obsessive entrepreneurial passion. Moreover, findings suggest golden-mean thinking negatively moderates the relationship between obsessive entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurial resilience yet positively moderates the relationship between social capital and entrepreneurial resilience. Based on these findings, we conclude that entrepreneurial resilience may be achieved more effectively through the complex internal process of social capital, entrepreneurial passion, and golden-mean thinking. Finally, the study proposes the theoretical and practical implications and suggestions for follow-up research.

In this paper, we employ a combination of bibliometric analysis and a structured review of recent influential articles to evaluate the domain of HO. As part of the bibliometric analysis, we analysed 676 documents containing 51,014 references by applying citation, co-citation, and social network analysis (SNA) techniques. Based on our analysis, we identified the 108 most influential works shaping the domain and explored the linkages between them to uncover the intellectual structure of the domain. Specifically, we observed five different clusters that depicted the intellectual structure of the HO domain. Our result further clarified the overall centrality features of the HO research network. Further, the structured review resulted in the identification of six different themes: impact of organizational actors on HO, impact of the external environment on HO, hybridization process and organizational response, organizational structure and governance, organizational strategy, and organizational performance.

Within the field of entrepreneurship education research, the influence of institutional management on teacher entrepreneurship competency (TEC) has attracted more attention as they are considered one of the key engines of economic recovery. Using quantitative research as well as SEM, a total of 1241 entrepreneurship education faculty members at China's double first-class universities were surveyed using a questionnaire. The results suggest that entrepreneurship group management (EGM) and mechanism protection (EMP) in institutions have a positive predictive effect on TEC, while a partial mediating effect exists after considering teacher entrepreneurial behaviours (TEB) (including Teacher's behaviour of innovation and autonomy (BIA) and resource seeking and management (BSM)). Overall, the management of entrepreneurship education in Chinese universities has a good effect on the development of TEC. Thus, the application of tripartite interaction theory in entrepreneurship education institutions provides a good reference for the personal sustainable development of entrepreneurship teachers. The significance of institutional management for teachers should shift from the traditional provision of work to professional development and growth. © 2023 The Authors","Entrepreneurship education management; Mediating role; Teacher competency; Triadic interaction theory",""

Leadership for disaster resilience has gained prominence in the face of global environmental change, and the need for collaboration, integration, and synergy in addressing this crisis is starker than ever. Drawing on case studies from across India, the volume focuses on leaderships of individuals, bureaucratic and political actors, civil society actors, and institutions. It looks at the ways in which disaster resilience leadership can address key challenges through the application of such theoretical perspectives as integrative public leadership, critical new institutionalism, and comparative realisation focused approaches to social justice. It highlights current leadership practices and envisages sustainable solutions to the environmental crisis by emphasising the need for disaster resilience leadership that could bring about systemic and socio-structural change. Presenting fresh perspectives on leadership research, the book will be an essential read for scholars and researchers of disaster management, social work, management studies, development studies, environmental studies, and public policy.

Based on survey data, we map out perceived barriers to collaboration whereby five categories emerge: teaching obligations, partner (dis)interest, partners’ resources, academic freedom, and university resources. By means of multiple regression analysis, we examine the extent to which individual, intra-, and inter-organisational factors explain these perceived barriers to collaboration. The study was carried out in Iceland, where university objectives are still heavily based on teaching activities, and few entrepreneurial activities take place in academia. Our results reveal that age and academic disciplines play a main role in the perceptions of academics regarding barriers to collaboration, especially when it comes to barriers grounded in teaching obligations or university resources. Most perceived barriers are based on the internal level that is lack of resources on behalf of universities. The study, therefore, provides a new perspective relative to earlier findings that have indicated that barriers to collaboration exist mostly at the individual level.

However, the mechanisms by which changes in institutional contexts and personality traits affect individuals’ entrepreneurial motivation have not received enough attention from researchers. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by examining the joint effects of personality traits and business barriers on one’s motivation to engage in entrepreneurial activity. A structured questionnaire was developed to capture the above linkages. To measure the latent variables, factor and reliability analyses were utilised. To examine the relationships, a regression analysis was performed on a unique dataset of respondents from three counties: Czechia, Hungary, and Serbia. The results show that personality traits positively influence motivation towards entrepreneurship. Furthermore, external barriers (ecological and technological issues), and infrastructure factors positively affect entrepreneurial motivation. From an academic viewpoint, personality traits and motivation to engage in entrepreneurial activity can be nourished by education, highlighting the role of universities in this regard.

Both stand out for their ability to contribute to sustainable development and generate competitive and social advantages. This study combined both approaches under the concept of CSR entrepreneurship (CSRE). A scale was developed to assess corporate socially responsible entrepreneurs’ traits in corporate contexts (i.e., CSRE-s). This quantitative measurement instrument was initially composed of 84 items, which were subjected to various validity and reliability tests. Exploratory factor and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to identify the most significant determinant variables of individuals engaging in CSRE. The validated CSRE-s indicates that the corporate socially responsible entrepreneurship construct involves 6 entrepreneurship factors and 3 CSR dimensions—environmental, social, and economic—with 2 factors each (i.e., 6 factors), assessed by a total of 76 items. This research’s main contribution is the identification of CSRE features in entrepreneurs that together constitute an original, unique, and innovative framework for a sustainable development approach to entrepreneurship. The proposed conceptual model can be used to ensure the CSR values validated for the CSRE-s are incorporated into entrepreneurial training programs (i.e., universities), the public sector’s policies promoting entrepreneurship, and strategic business plans for expansion via entrepreneurship.

Findings: This study proposes a new multi-integration model of moderation-mediation analysis. The innovative business model explores the relationship between entrepreneurial factors and competitive advantage. Based on a survey of 606 staff members and managers of tourism and hospitality firms, entrepreneurs in the tourism and hospitality industry with entrepreneurial attitudes and motives had opportunities to increase their entrepreneurial orientation. Practical implications: In the process of innovative entrepreneurship, whether through organizational learning or other enterprise cooperation, it is necessary to pay more attention and propose different environmental management strategies. In addition, this study also found that marketing uncertainty moderates between entrepreneurial attitudes and entrepreneurial motives. Entrepreneurial motives are more conservative than other motives, and there is increased confidence in investing in innovative entrepreneurship in stable environments.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses the human capital theoretical lens to make its argument and applies it to data obtained from exploratory qualitative research (55 semi-structured interviews and nine focus groups) in the developing countries of Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador. Findings: Universities can promote different forms of non-commercial AE even in the absence of sophisticated resources for innovation, through the stimulation of the specific human capital of the university community resulting from activities where they help others. Originality/value: This paper proposes a general framework for advancing theory development in AE and its non-commercial forms, based on data obtained in uncharted territories for AE. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurial orientation; Human capital; Social entrepreneurship; Social impact",""

Despite the widely acknowledged importance and benefits of environmental management accounting (EMA), the level of adoption and implementation of EMA practice is still weak within SMEs in many countries, especially in China. The current systematic review aims to identify the barriers affecting the Chinese SMEs for adopting EMA practices along with the critical success factors required for adopting EMA practices by SMEs and their top management for ensuring sustainable corporate environmental performance in China. The study is carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. In total, 73 articles were found to be eligible to be included in the systematic review, which was published on EMA in small- and medium-sized enterprises in China. Our study aims to document barriers to the adoption of EMA among Chinese SMEs. The review concluded that strict legislation and the availability of flexible financing options for SMEs can promote the adoption of EMA by SMEs. The establishment of environmental reporting systems and auditing mechanisms can further increase the utilization of EMA by small and medium firms. Barriers to EMA adoption can be mitigated after careful consideration of the current situation in SMEs. Documentation of significant barriers may help to form supportive policies which ultimately add to the efforts toward climate change mitigation.

Assessment frameworks that expand the scope from academic performance to actual contributions to SD can support business schools in this regard. This article addresses the current lack of pluralistic conceptualizations of research impacts and aims to propose an assessment framework and indicators for business school research impacts on SD. It thus investigates the contributions of business school research to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through an explorative case analysis of Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Vienna) and grounded theory's constant comparative method. In doing so, it adds value to the discussion about the societal relevance of business schools and pluralistic assessments of their research impacts. The findings illustrate that business school research impacts the economy, policy making, and education by fostering organizational and systemic change and contributes to overcoming societal and environmental challenges. The proposed framework contributes to shifting the focus of research impact assessment of business schools toward SD. It shows that business schools must holistically recognize their impacts by considering key SD impact areas, impact scope and pathways, and their actual contributions to the SDGs. © 2021 The Author.

The global isomorphic pressure prevalent in higher education (e.g. the global regime of rankings) drives latecomers to imitate the practices of incumbents in order to enhance their academic impact through business and management research. Our study argues that latecomers respond to global isomorphism by forging their own paths. Our analysis shows that business knowledge production in Hong Kong and Singapore was more responsive to coercive (research strategy) and normative (faculty recruitment strategy) isomorphic pressure than Korea and Taiwan. The response to mimetic isomorphic pressure (co-authorship strategy) was less salient in Hong Kong and Taiwan than in Singapore and Korea. Further, we find that research, faculty recruitment, and co-authorship strategies affect the academic impact (citations) of the higher education institutions across each country differently.

Developing Capacity for Innovation in Complex Systems offers insights into the history of the idea of innovation, as well as knowledge around different discourses on innovation. The purpose of this book is to help organisations further their aspirations and work with innovation. It is based on three premises: (1) that capacity can be developed, (2) that it is worthwhile trying to do so, and (3) there are however no guarantees for success. Providing a comprehensive view of innovation and discussing the theoretical challenges, the book contributes towards a holistic theory for capacity building for innovation. The book conveys frameworks, methodologies, and tools that are used in terms of innovation, and it explains positive strategies for innovation that are being developed. Complexity theory is presented and attributed to the construct of innovation to further the understanding of the intricacies and fallacies of innovation work. This book will be of direct interest to scholars and subject matter experts in the field of innovation management.

This chapter provides a systematic review of how social psychological constructs and related agentic theory have been used to address questions relevant to individual agency in the context of sociotechnical sustainability transitions. Our motivating premise is that an understanding of higher-level transitions processes is incomplete without an understanding of why people act as they do. We find that light, simultaneous reference to social psychology and sociotechnical transitions remains sizeable and is ongoing. The social psychology-related approaches used can be categorised as: (i) variable based psychology; (ii) information, framing and risk; (iii) social practice, culture and lifestyle; (iv) representations and expectations; (v) reviews, syntheses and systems models; (vi) values, norms and traits; (vii) place attachment; (viii) societal and organizational-level concepts. We discuss related ontological issues and conclude that social psychological-related approaches may usefully complement sociotechnical, co-evolutionary approaches to sustainability transitions, with varying degrees of integration being possible. © Satu Teerikangas, Tiina Onkila, Katariina Koistinen and Marileena Mäkelä 2021.","",""

Adopting a multidisciplinary approach, this book offers insights into the new opportunities, threats and challenges that the growing ageing-tourism markets poses. The ageing population has created a demographic time bomb with a population structure that is skewed towards a growing proportion of older people. When this is combined with the impact of health conditions, such as dementia, the future shape of visitor demand and tourism behaviour is likely to change and face many new challenges, albeit at different rates in time and space. Chapters include cutting-edge insights into future issues, while interviews are used to illustrate and explain issues affecting ageing and tourism, creating a much-needed synthesis of the ageing-tourism nexus to demonstrate intellectual leadership around this theme.

The shift is seen in the way that a discursive use of the term service provision with embedded logics encompassing fiscal accountability, performance measurement, efficiency, and process regulation has changed towards discourses that embrace collaboration between the public sector front staff and the citizens, with the aim of developing legitimate and effective welfare services that are co-produced by means of active participation and distributed decision making. However, this change requires new approaches to the way in which the implementation of new practices and tools is executed in practice as studied and researched, and how the new practices and tools are understood and evaluated in organizations. Processual Perspectives on the Co-Production Turn in Public Sector Organizations is an essential reference book that examines, unfolds, and develops approaches to co-production and implementation as dynamic, processual, collaborative, sensemaking, and as requiring and resulting in capacity building and learning. Moreover, the book examines new approaches to engage citizens and public sector actors in collaborative and co-productive processes, especially with concern for new goals pertaining to sustainability, social equity, democratic legitimacy, etc. Covering topics that include knowledge management and collective leadership, the book presents perspectives on capacity building, learning, change, and evaluation in organizations and current research in different areas of the public sector. It is intended for public sector administrators and managers investigating the relevancy, approaches, and methods in co-production.

Drawing from decades of research on social, cognitive, and organizational psychology, as well as a deep well of historical research, this book shows how commitment to groups, organizations, and movements can turn moral individuals into amoral agents. Pulling together what have been traditionally distinct areas of study, How Groups Encourage Misbehavior provides a detailed and unified account of how good organizations go bad and how groups of all types can push otherwise honest and upright individuals to behave in ways that violate laws and social norms. This text describes how social norms, rationalization, the characteristics of formal and informal groups, attachment to groups and organizations, and the structure of organizational life can all contribute to misbehavior. Each chapter includes one or more sidebar discussions of relevant and interesting examples to illustrate the ways groups and organizations encourage and support misbehavior. The final two chapters discuss how many of these same attributes and processes can be used to encourage positive behaviors and foster recovery from dysfunctional and corrupt cultures and modes of behavior.

To address this, we conducted a systematic review of systematic reviews published in management research since the early 2000s (N = 391).

Research is expected to produce new knowledge that is both relevant in academia and of direct practical use in society. Universities are well placed to serve as links between global academic communities and local problem owners. However, playing this pivotal role is problematic because in practice there is a tendency to frame the dual role of producing socially relevant and academic knowledge in terms of an artificial distinction between applied consultancy and basic research. Considering the challenges faced by universities in playing a more proactive role in addressing the practical challenges faced by their home regions, we propose the term transformative academic institutions to refer to research centres created within universities to proactively engage in the socioeconomic development of the regions in which they are rooted. We propose an experimental framework that can help map the relationship between their role in a global academic knowledge community and their role in the (local) practical knowledge community. The framework is developed from on our own experience working in an academic institution that conducts research to strengthen regional socioeconomic development processes. We experiment with the framework through an application to our own research context in the period 2016-19.

However, the approaches used to analyze the entrepreneurial intention and venture creation are mostly linear approaches, leaving aside the fact that new ventures arise in a context characterized by fluctuations and instability, especially in emerging economies where economic and social factors are highly variables. Nevertheless, a dynamic approach could best represent its behavior. This study aims to propose an alternative approach and a starting point for more complex dynamic models in the entrepreneurship process that surpass the limitation of the current linear methodologies and allow gathering isolated studies' contributions. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a method to shed light on the processes related to the venture creation process and entrepreneurial intention by designing a system dynamics simulation model. Findings: The results reveal that the delayed effect of expectations produces a growing tendency in project creation, venture establishment and venture creation. Likewise, the entrepreneurial intention is not a static variable; it changes by the system’s dynamics and disturbs the venture creation process, which produces an increase in oscillations in the model and, therefore, reduces the project’s growth and venture creation. Research limitations/implications: This model is a generic approach for the study of venture creation and entrepreneurial intention. The model can analyze entrepreneurial intention and venture creation in different contexts, adjusting the different model parameters. The authors run a sensitivity analysis to encompass deviation from the parameter established and the uncertainty about them. However, the empirical data used for the model’s testing, in this case, correspond to an approximation to the behavior of venture creation in Colombia, which is considered an emerging economy. The model proposed does not pretend to incorporate all the variables and phenomena about entrepreneurship. Originality/value: The approach suggested in this work aims to conceptualize venture creation as a complex process that emerges from the occurrence and combination of simpler states, instead of activities that represent building blocks.

However, research on this topic is dispersed and fragmented across various research domains and contexts. In this paper, we provide a broader perspective on the relationship between gender and poverty entrepreneurship. The purpose of this review is to acknowledge and critically discuss the variety of studies on gender and poverty entrepreneurship published over the last three decades. Using a systematic literature review process and an inductive categorization, we offer an overarching framework for organizing what we know about gendered entrepreneurial activity under poverty conditions including the relevant antecedents, mechanisms, outcomes and characteristics. In doing so, this article develops a roadmap of the current knowledge and provides suggestions to guide future research.  © World Scientific Publishing Company.","Female entrepreneurs; Gender; Literature review; Poverty entrepreneurship",""

However, little is known about these variables’ comparative influence on the development of nascent ventures in countries with different levels of gross domestic product per capita. This research compares the effects of self-perceptions, perceived subjective norms, and first-hand connections with entrepreneurs on participation in nascent entrepreneurs in Latin America. Logistic regressions are performed and the resulting coefficient magnitudes and pseudo-R2 values compared for the populations of 11 countries in this region. The evidence reveals heterogeneity in the effect of these psychological and social attributes on nascent ventures’ creation process, conditional on different levels of gross domestic product per capita. Notably, higher economic development is positively related to a greater influence of these perceptual and social variables. The findings enhance understanding of the effects of key variables from theories of entrepreneurial behaviour, incorporating economic development level as a new determinant. In addition, the results could guide programmes aimed at strengthening entrepreneurship in Latin America by supporting the adaptation of efforts to support nascent entrepreneurship according to the influence of perceptual and social variables in different countries. © 2021, The Author(s).","Economic development; Nascent entrepreneurship; Self-perceptions; Social capital; Social norms",""

Ongoing entrepreneurship and strategic management debates require a better understanding of the relationship between workplace generational cohorts’ configurations and organizational performance. We propose a conceptual model for understanding how a diversified workforce influences some determinants (i.e., employees’ human capital and attitudes, organizational climate, and environmental conditions) of entrepreneurial organizations’ outcomes (i.e., corporate venturing). Our framework offers insights into corporate venturing determinants for three generational cohorts: Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y. Using a sample of 20,256 employees across 28 countries, our findings lend support to the positive effect of individual and organizational determinants on corporate venturing, as well as how these effects are reinforced per generational cohort. Specifically, our results show that younger generations (millennials) have more propensity to be involved in corporate venturing activities.

As per the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2020, which measures the participation of men and women across health, education, economic and political activity, India overall ranked 112th of the 153 countries covered, slipping 4 steps down from its 108th position of the 2018 report. The economic gap is deeper still, as India ranks 149th amongst the 153 participant countries. The Indian economy is characterized by informality and labor market frictions, and the participation of women in entrepreneurship has gained much policy impetus in recent times as an alternative route not only to superior equality but also to economic growth. The promotion of women in the entrepreneurial landscape has been central to all policy discussions. However, despite a conducive regulatory environment, there is much room for improvement of the prevailing situation where India lags far behind at the 70th and 52nd position in the GEDI's Female Entrepreneurship Index 2015 and Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs 2019, respectively. This necessitates investigation of the cognitive and socio-cultural factors curbing the entrepreneurial potential of Indian women to understand and improve the prevailing situation for the benefit of the nation at large. This book aims to provide suggestive evidence towards identifying the cognitive and socio-cultural factors affecting the entrepreneurial intentions of Indian women. The major source of evidence was GEM India consortium data for 5 years, from 2014 to 2019. The major objectives of this study included: (i) a detailed survey of literature to understand the situation of women entrepreneurship in India, (ii) to understand and report the cognitive, behavioural and socio-cultural factors affecting the entrepreneurial intentions of Indian women and, (iii) based on this study, identify and suggest policy measures to improve the situation of female participation in entrepreneurship in the country. This book covers an overview of the major global efforts to measure women entrepreneurship as well as a thorough review of literature on the global perspectives pertaining to strategies, general environment and policies related to promoting women entrepreneurship in 14 countries: Bangladesh, China, Malaysia, Australia, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom, Botswana, South Africa, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil and the United States of America. The understanding about the global strategies, policies as well as challenges faced by women entrepreneurs was an important exercise in understanding how entrepreneurship can be promoted across the length and breadth of geographical locations, having diversity in socio-economic and institutional structures as well as different levels of entrepreneurial activity. A detailed overview of the prevailing situation of women entrepreneurship was also presented for India, with respect to the facts and figures of entrepreneurial activity, policies, existing schemes to boost participation of women in entrepreneurship, institutional supports available and the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs.

Schumpeter (1942) defined “entrepreneurship” as more than just starting a new business, as it involves introducing revolutionary changes in business methods and practices. Exploration, amalgamation and utilisation of new technologies have become one of the key challenges, but also of opportunities for entrepreneurship, and no industry is considered to be unaffected by its impacts. Further, the Covid-19 global pandemic has taken a huge toll on lives and economies globally, leading the business world into faster technological transformation primarily through business digitalisation. These challenging transformations call for problem solving through mindful innovation and fast responses, which tap into what has been construed as the essence of entrepreneurs. However, from the emergent lessons of the pandemic, it is becoming clear that a consideration of the ethical and sustainable aspects of entrepreneurial activities is essential, when pursuing financial success by tapping into the potential of ever-increasing technology developments. Hence, the need for technoentrepreneurial education taking the above into account is increasingly acknowledged among higher education authorities worldwide, and by governments who have a key responsibility for investment in entrepreneurship education programmes.

Research has shown that the university environment plays a decisive role in the spin-off activities of researchers. Although the number of science-based spin-offs has increased in recent years, women are still an exception when it comes to developing spin-off ventures. In turn, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the university environment that supports entrepreneurship from a gender perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the theoretical framework of the “Entrepreneurial University,” this contribution examines the formal and informal conditions for academic entrepreneurship using the example of Swiss universities of applied sciences (UAS). Based on a cross-sectional dataset of 1,551 researchers from various disciplines who were surveyed in 2019, linear regressions and logistic regression models were used to test gender-specific differences in the perception of organizational conditions concerning the entrepreneurial exploitation of research. Findings: The results demonstrated significant differences in the perception of formal and informal conditions in higher education. First, they show gender differences in the perception of informal entrepreneurial support in universities; in particular, female researchers received less informal support for spin-off projects. For example, women hardly viewed commercial use of research and development knowledge as a career option and considered the existence of entrepreneurial role models at universities to be low. Second, further analyses highlighted that also formal support offerings were less known among female researchers. Originality/value: The study highlights organizational barriers for female researchers regarding the development of spin-off creation at UAS, including the different formal and informal conditions for female academics in comparison to their male counterparts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic entrepreneurship; Gender; Organizational framework; Spin-off",""

Unfortunately, many organisations fail to adequately formulate social problems and even solve the wrong ones, which is due to their inherent complexity. Consequently, this dissertation adopts a 'complexity lens' to interpret the intertwined forces driving social problems within organisational and environmental contexts. Problem complexity requires different governance modes, as solutions cannot be developed in the typical linear and hierarchical process that commercial products follow. To this end, this dissertation entails two studies that explore how the complexity of social problems can be managed at the organisational and individual level.

This research employs New Institutional Theory to investigate the coercive, mimetic and normative drivers behind the adoption of social procurement policies in Australian construction projects. It presents a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with sixteen social procurement actors in the Australian construction industry who are responsible for implementing these policies at a project level. Results contribute new theoretical and practical insights into the nascent and under-theorized body of social procurement research in the field of project management. They indicate that coercive isomorphism is the most powerful driver of social procurement adoption in Australian construction projects, followed by mimetic isomorphism and normative isomorphism. It is concluded that the effective implementation of social procurement policies in construction projects requires project supply chains to shift from a compliance and mimicking mindset to one which normalizes social procurement. This will require institutional change based on the legitimisation of new social procurement professionals, roles and practices and the development of new project-based intermediaries to mitigate the risks and maximize the opportunities that social procurement presents. © 2021","Institutions; Isomorphism; Social impact; Social outcomes; Social procurement; Social value","Australia; Construction industry; Project management; Supply chains; Construction projects; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Institutional change; New Institutional Theory; Procurement policy; Procurement professionals; Semi structured interviews; Thematic analysis; compliance; construction industry; institutional framework; project assessment; project management; social impact; social policy; Set theory"

The interviewees were from the public, private, academia, and faith-based sectors and included interventions that impacted food insecurity, education, health, the built environment, crime, and substance and alcohol abuse. The findings showed the importance of trust as a hybrid logic impacting collaborations at multiple levels; we link this to additional findings on the level of structural embeddedness in the studied neighborhoods. The findings support the need for public health and community leaders to address gaps in trust/embeddedness in order to improve the success of community interventions.

Problemistic search theory suggests that entrepreneurs will seek out sponsors in moments of venture distress.

We use three inductive studies conducted in favelas in Brazil to examine when entrepreneurs seek help. Consistent with problemistic search theory, we find evidence that entrepreneurs seek out help from organizational sponsors in moments of venture distress. We also explore what types of entrepreneurs are most likely to seek help in a situation of venture distress and find that entrepreneurs who are more socially embedded and have more social obligations are more likely to take up sponsorship services, leading to important heterogeneity in our results on take-up. We find that women, more mature ventures, and middle-aged entrepreneurs are all more likely to engage in problemistic search.

In comparison, much less evidence has been produced on start-ups created by students and graduates, mainly due to a lack of comprehensive data. This paper evaluates the impact of education—academic subject and foreign education experience—on the creation of firms by university graduates. In terms of the academic subject, the focus is on the distinction between science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and non-STEM fields. With respect to foreign education experience, the focus is on graduates’ experience studying outside their home country. Our analysis extends the scope of existing research in two ways. First, we consider the entire education history of graduates, not just from the researched university. Second, the paper extends the traditional focus on international students and analyzes the foreign education experience of both domestic and international students. The results indicate a positive relationship between having a non-STEM degree and entrepreneurial activity. A combination of STEM and non-STEM degrees is also positively related to the entrepreneurial propensity of graduates. Students with foreign education experience are significantly more likely to become entrepreneurs than those without such experience. Many governments focus their policy on attracting and retaining foreign students, especially those with degrees in STEM fields. Our results suggest that it is more important for a government to focus on both foreign-born students and domestic students who have foreign study experience. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Entrepreneurship; Foreign education; Policy; STEM",""

We use the novel data for 1,652 ecosystem actors across sixteen cities in nine developing and transition economies during 2018–2019 to examine the role that institutional context plays in facilitating the productive entrepreneurship and reducing the unproductive entrepreneurship. This study is the first to develop and test a model of multi-dimensional institutional arrangements in cities. It demonstrates that not just that institutions matter in shaping the entrepreneurship ecosystem in cities, but in particular those institutional arrangements enhancing the productive and reducing unproductive entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest that differences between normative, cognitive, and regulatory pillars are associated with variance in both types of entrepreneurship in cities. For the formation of productive and high-growth entrepreneurs, all three pillars of institutional arrangement matter.

Agripreneurship is a new way of transforming agriculture into an enterprise in current business practices. This paper is written in the context of India, where many efforts have been made to encourage sustainable economic growth and development over the past decades. However, no significant progress has been seen in the agri-industry. The Indian agricultural sector is also afflicted with several other challenges related to the globalized economy, natural resource degradation, widespread rural poverty, and increasing competitiveness. In this study, we have endeavored to create an agripreneur inclination model in the context of the Indian rural sector. The objective of this study is to identify programs and policies that effectively support the development of agripreneurs. We also attempt to identify the characteristics of individuals who are more likely to become agripreneurs. The methodology we have used is based on the ISM–MICMAC technique. The findings show that agripreneur courses, agricultural policies, training and development modules, government cooperation, and the involvement of institutional heads play an essential role in inspiring the younger generation toward agripreneurship.

Research on students opting for social entrepreneurial ventures as a career option is yet to be studied in-depth in the Indian context. The present study will help create a suitable ecosystem in higher education institutions through well-designed student engagement initiatives to convert job seekers into social value creators. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The study used a questionnaire submitted to 439 students to collect their responses on the initiatives taken by higher education institutions in India to kindle students’ social entrepreneurial intent. Smart PLS methodology was used to test the model. FINDINGS: The findings show that prior experience, empathy, self-efficacy, and perceived social support directly impact social entrepreneurial intentions (SEI). In contrast, moral obligation has no impact on SEI in the Indian context. Student’s exposure to organisations that deal with social causes is the most preferred student engagement initiative. ORIGINALITY: There are few studies in India on higher education institutions’ role in kindling social entrepreneurial intent among students. The present study proposed dedicated student engagement initiatives to bridge the gap in the existing literature on social entrepreneurship in the given context. IMPLICATIONS: Higher education institutions’ student engagement initiatives can kindle social entrepreneurial intent among students pragmatic with an inclusive approach.

The framework is aimed at mobilizing knowledge resources to bridge the rural-urban knowledge divide while securing rural empowerment using digital connections and social collaborations built on strategies of self-sustenance and self-development. With key empirical findings supplemented by relevant theoretical structures, case studies, illustrative figures and a lucid style, the book combines social technologies and social development to derive a social knowledge management platform. It shows how the proposed SKM framework can enhance knowledge capabilities of rural actors by facilitating connection among rural-urban entities through formation of purposive virtual communities, which allow social agents to create, modify and share content collaboratively. The volume brings forward diverse issues such as conceptual foundations; bridging the rural-urban knowledge and information divide; issues of information and knowledge asymmetry; a knowledge-theoretic perspective of rural empowerment; knowledge capability, freedom of choice and wellbeing, to provide a comprehensive outlook on building a knowledge society through digital empowerment.

This study explores the conceptual domain of SI leadership in HE. Drawing on the insights of 22 experienced practitioners in Canada, it provides a concept map to help guide leadership practice and research. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted Group Concept Mapping (GCM), a mixed methods approach that provides a structured way to map the “conceptual domain” of a topic from the perspectives of those with close knowledge of it. Using online GCM software, one group of participants generated statements in response to a prompting question about SI leadership. Another group sorted statements into conceptual groups, rating them for importance. The authors then produced a preliminary map using cluster analysis. A third group interpreted that map. The authors analyzed interpretation data to produce a final concept map, which is discussed in light of relevant literature. Findings: GCM methodology resulted in 108 statements about SI leadership, with the vast majority ranked as highly important. The analysis produced a map consisting of nine “clusters” of conceptually related ideas about SI leadership, encapsulated under three interacting areas of focus: individual, relational, institutional/system. Participants confirmed the map reflected key dimensions of practice, noting it indicated important tensions and paradoxes core to their practice. Their interpretations highlighted how the map represented iterative dynamics of leadership over time and across levels; and how different theoretical and practice traditions in SI communities affect conceptualizations of leadership. Research limitations/implications: The study suggests that an area ripe for study is the navigation of micro-level systems in pursuit of meso-level and macro-level systems change. The map provides an empirically derived set of dimensions for instrument development in future SI leadership studies. The context of conventional academic institutions bounds the results but helps to surface key considerations for researching SI processes in other mature institutions. Comparison of findings with extant leadership theories suggests that, to advance theoretical research on the topic of leadership in SI, bricolage or new theory development will be needed. Practical implications: The map paints broad themes with concrete, practice-level ideas. It can serve as a touchstone for reflection by experienced practitioners and offers a reference point to orient those new to leading SI. Originality/value: The scholarly knowledge base about SI has been growing rapidly, but it is still an emerging field of study. There are only a handful of published studies offering perspectives on SI in HE, and none with respect to SI leadership in HE. This study offers original conceptual insights grounded in empirical data gathered through a method aligned with its exploratory purpose. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Higher education; Leadership; Leadership practice; Social change; Social innovation; Universities",""

To address such challenges, researchers can work collaboratively with practitioners to identify and tackle the most pressing issues. Yet, intentionally establishing an ongoing dialogue not only between researchers and practitioners but between researchers, practitioners, and the communities that PA scholarship and practice are intended to impact can enhance all stakeholders' understanding of complex social problems and improve solutions. Forms of participatory and context-based research such as this are called many things across disciplines, but PA has yet to embrace such approaches fully. Thus, we introduce a framework entitled CO-DESIGN, intended to illustrate the process of advancing PA research through the co-production of knowledge between researchers, practitioners, and communities.

We explain these types through responses to institutional complexity between commercial and responsibility logics. Strategic responses were enabled or constrained by the characteristics of the varying spaces of institutional complexity of particular corporations. We contribute to an emerging heterogeneous business model literature by providing empirical evidence.

It advances new understanding on how Nigerian entrepreneurs trust in their indigenous institutions such as family ties, kinship, chieftaincy, religion, cooperatives and trade associations to resolve disputes arising from their exporting activities as opposed to dormant formal institutions in their country. Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study adopts an interpretive research paradigm, and it utilises a case study strategy. Data collected through observations, archival records and qualitative conversations with 36 exporting Nigerian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is analysed by utilising a combination of within and cross-case analysis techniques. Doing so enabled an in-depth study of the methods their owner-managers use in order to take advantage of the relationships they established through their long-standing cultural institutions in the place of weak formal institutions in their country. Findings: Indigenous institutions have evolved to replace formalised institutions within the business environment in Nigeria. They have developed to become an alternative and trusted arbiter for solving SMEs' export issues because of weak/dysfunctional formal institutions in the Western African country. The owner-managers of exporting SMEs perceive formal institutions as representing a fragmented system that does not benefit their export businesses. Practical implications: The findings demonstrate that there is need for policymakers to consider the role of informal institutions in the Nigerian context. Such an approach is essential given the economic importance and increasing number of SMEs that trade and export their goods through informal structures in Nigeria. Originality/value: The study indicates that it is not just the void or absence of institutions that exist in a developing country such as Nigeria, but weak/dysfunctional formal institutions have been replaced by culturally embedded informal institutions. Thus, the study provides a new theoretical avenue depicting the concept of trusting in indigenous institutions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Exporting SMEs; Indigenous Institutions; Nigeria; SMEs; Trust",""

This study aims to highlight the antecedents of sustainable social impact. Thus, we evaluate the association between entrepreneurial orientation and social impact through the mediation effects of social factors named social drivers, including service innovation, social innovation, and social value orientation. The data collection is from the service and non-service industries in Taiwan. A total of 270 samples consisting of employees, managers, SME owners, and CEOs is used. We employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the proposed hypotheses. Research findings indicate entrepreneurial orientation is a determining factor of sustainable innovation that not only renders entrepreneurially strategic dispositions of an organization but also significantly contributes to generating drastic social impact. In particular, entrepreneurs are found to be more proactive in solving problematic social issues through their entrepreneurial characteristics. Statistical findings support that all direct effects, besides partial and full mediation, are proved, which reveals the transformative potential of selected social drivers. Altogether, research findings provide exciting insights into entrepreneurship knowledge, innovation, and value assumptions in the social context.

They turn out to be risk taker, autonomous, proactive, competitive, and innovative. In a nutshell, they are entrepreneurial oriented with the aim to generate new innovative ventures, known as research-based spin offs. Doubly, this has induced an improvement of technology transfer and the degree of entrepreneurship in the current knowledge economy. However there still is a paucity of studies on the spill over effect of entrepreneurial orientated universities and research-based spin off on technology transfer need to be more explored. Therefore, the article investigates the link between entrepreneurial orientation and such spill overs by offering an outlook of two universities and two research-based spin offs in the United Kingdom. The scope is to provide a deep view of technological innovativeness in a research context, entrepreneurial oriented. Our research suggests that entrepreneurial attitude has become an imperative to succeed in the context where British institutions currently operate.

Such policies challenge deeply rooted institutional norms and structures in the construction industry and research shows that they are being championed by a small and largely undefined group of social procurement professionals who suffer significant role conflict and ambiguity. Contributing new insights to this nascent research, this paper traces etymological definitions of champion roles, merging them with organisational theory to present a new typology of social procurement champions in the construction industry. Drawing on a thematic analysis of snowballed interviews with fifteen recognised champions of social procurement in the Australian construction industry, findings highlight four distinct types of social procurement champion: champions of organisations; champions of the concept; champions of people; and champions of a solution. It is found that there is no one pure type of social procurement champion. Rather, champions have to adapt their social procurement roles to the highly dynamic and varied organisation contexts in which they operate. These findings advance the emerging social procurement debate within and outside construction by highlighting the many different roles which are needed to implement social innovations like social procurement into a project-based industry like construction. It is concluded that organisations which see this as one person’s responsibility are likely to fail in implementing these new policy reforms. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","champions; corporate social responsibility; professionals; Social innovation; social procurement; social value","Australia; Supply chains; Champion; Collaborative policy; Construction supply chain; Corporate social responsibility; Engineering industries; Policy tools; Social innovations; Social problems; Social procurement; Social values; construction industry; corporate social responsibility; engineering; governance approach; industrial performance; industrial policy; innovation; policy analysis; policy implementation; policy reform; research work; Construction industry"

In the past 5 years, in particular, the academic debate has focused on the elements that configure entrepreneurship ecosystems and their influence on the creation of high-growth ventures. Previous studies have also recognised the heterogeneity of environmental conditions (including policies, support programs, funding, culture, professional infrastructure, university support, labour market, R&D, and market dynamics) across regions/countries. Yet, an in-depth discussion is required to address how environmental conditions vary per entrepreneurial stage of enterprises within certain regions/countries, as well as how these conditions determine the technological factor of the entrepreneurial process. By reviewing the literature from 2000 to 2017, this paper analyses the environmental conditions that have influenced the transitions towards becoming potential entrepreneurs, nascent/new entrepreneurs, and established/consolidated entrepreneurs in both developed and developing economies. Our findings show why diversity in entrepreneurship and context is significant. Favourable conditions include professional support, incubators/accelerators, networking with multiple agents, and R&D investments. Less favourable conditions include a lack of funding sources, labour market conditions, and social norms.

This study aims at empirically investigating success conditions associated with entrepreneurship in the digital news business. Seven broader “super”-conditional prerequisites are considered: Experience, skills, personality, product, business model, company organization, and broader environment. The data, collected through 49 interviews with digital journalistic entrepreneurs in Germany, is analysed with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), a set theoretical method to determine necessity/sufficiency of preformulated conditions for a respective outcome (i.e., entrepreneurial (non-)success).

In recent years, firms have encountered a new logic in which interdependent parties are not formal organizations but platform-based ‘customer-entrepreneurs’ that create value through illegal means. Drawing on a 5-year-long qualitative study, we examine how firms recognize and instantiate this new logic and, consequently, respond to their interdependencies with customer-entrepreneurs. Viewed through the lens of institutional logic, we find that, with the benefit of hindsight, firms recognize the existence of the logic of customer entrepreneurship, which triggers organizational sensemaking that is made up of three elements: interpretation of legitimacy compatibility; interpretation of efficiency compatibility; and integration of stakeholder perspectives. This sensemaking results in either a determined account concluding on the compatibility calculus in a top-down manner, or an open-ended account avoiding the construction of a resolute, synthesized view. A determined account leads to a defiance strategy, by which firms attempt to remove the source of interdependencies with customer-entrepreneurs, whereas an open-ended account guides firms to espouse a decoupling strategy, whereby firms covertly resort to efficiency maximization enabled by the interdependence.

The authors use their unique approach to highlight recurring moral challenges in organizational behavior, such as leadership, work motivation, diversity, organizational change and stakeholder relations. Their analysis explains that people are reluctant to acknowledge and confront moral flaws in their workplace behavior, because this constitutes a source of identity threat.

Business and Environmental Sustainability looks at the environmental aspect of sustainability for all organisations pursuing competitive advantage. The book provides theoretical foundations from science, economics, policy and strategy, introduces three environmental challenges (climate change, pollution and waste) and looks at how corporate functions can address these. This textbook provides a thorough foundation by introducing readers to the science, reasoning and theory behind environmental sustainability and then delves into how these ideas translate into principles and business models for organisations to use. Next, it covers environmental challenges from climate change, pollution and waste, and then goes on to examine the different corporate functions (from supply chain management to human resources) to illustrate how environmental sustainability is managed and put into practice in organisations. Finally, a set of integrative case studies draws everything together and enables the reader to apply various analytical tools, with the aim of understanding how companies can not only reduce their environmental footprint but can positively contribute to environmental sustainability. Written by an award-winning lecturer, Business and Environmental Sustainability boasts a wealth of pedagogical features, including examples from a range of industries and countries, plus a companion website with slides, quiz questions and instructor material. This will be a valuable text for students of business, management and environmental sustainability and will also be suitable for broader courses on corporate responsibility and sustainability across environmental studies, political science and engineering. © 2021 Sigrun M.

That is why this study focuses on entrepreneurial intentions from an alternative theoretical perspective in an underexplored context. In this paper, it is argued that social cognitive career theory is relevant to the study of individual entrepreneurial cognition and behaviour, and it offers a solid framework in entrepreneurship research. This paper expands on SCCT's conceptualisation of environmental determinants, proposing the examination of how a new combination of contextual factors (perceived educational, relational and structural support), entrepreneurial self-efficacy, individual entrepreneurial orientation and negative outcome expectations are related to entrepreneurial intentions. For this exploratory study, a questionnaire completed by a sample of students from Poland, one of the Central and Eastern European countries, was employed. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed support for the role of SCCT variables in predicting entrepreneurial intentions. The results, which offer direct useful indications for further research activities, are presented and discussed.

On the other hand, studies examining the role of education discover that education continuously fails to play the desired role. Therefore, claims are made that 'education quality' is denting. Keeping this view in mind, this research is conducted to assess the education quality, making a comparison between the official measurement scale and 'inter-counterparts' perception'. Both primary and secondary data are used. According to the official measurement scale, 'education quality' has been improved substantially for every provision-primary to tertiary. Apparently, the entire system functions well where performances and 'education quality' of all provisions are synchronised. On the other hand, 'inter-counterparts' perception' indicates that 'education quality' of all provisions deteriorates gradually and they live in an isolation.

We have lived with this system for decades, and the result is clear: a small number of regions and cities are at the top of the high-tech industry, but many more are fighting a losing battle to retain economic dynamism. But, as this books details, there are other models for innovation-based growth that don’t rely on a flourishing high-tech industry. Breznitz argues that the purveyors of the dominant ideas on innovation have a feeble understanding of the big picture on global production and innovation. They conflate innovation with invention and suffer from techno-fetishism. In their devotion to start-ups, they refuse to admit that the real obstacle to growth for most cities is the overwhelming power of the real hubs, which siphon up vast amounts of talent and money. Communities waste time, money, and energy pursuing this road to nowhere. Instead, Breznitz proposes that communities focus on where they fit within the four stages in the global production process. Success lies in understanding the changed structure of the global system of production and then using those insights to enable communities to recognize their own advantages, which in turn allows to them to foster surprising forms of specialized innovation. All localities have certain advantages relative to at least one stage of the global production process, and the trick is in recognizing it. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Distribution; Economic growth; Global production; Globalization; Innovation; Local economic growth; Prosperity; Public policy; Strategy",""

It establishes a behavioural theory of economic development illustrating that differences in human behaviour across cities and regions are a significant deep-rooted cause of uneven development. Fusing a range of concepts relating to culture, psychology, human agency, institutions, and power, it proposes that the uneven economic development and evolution of cities and regions within and across nations are strongly connected with the underlying forms of behaviour enacted by humans both individually and collectively. Integrating theoretical and empirical analysis, the book builds upon entrepreneurial and innovation theories of economic evolution to make sense of the cultural, psychological, and agentic components and elements of city and regional economic ecosystems that lead to long-term differentials in development. For social scientists with an interest in understanding the nature of uneven economic development, the book provides a novel theory of the role of human behaviour, psychocultural context, and institutions in the evolution and uneven development of cities and regions. This human behaviour is framed in the form of the 'behavioural profile' of cities and regions encompassing citizens in terms of their personalities, cultural histories, aspirations, and perceived opportunities, as well as their broader propensities to act in certain ways. © Robert Huggins and Piers Thompson 2021.","Culture; Economic development; Entrepreneurship; Human agency; Human behaviour; Innovation; Institutions; Networks; Personality psychology; Power",""

Specifically, this study aims to achieve two objectives: first, to determine if students’ ATB, SN, PBC and EIs would increase significantly after their exposure to EE; and second, to establish whether students’ ATB, SN and PBC mediate the relationship between EE and their EIs. Design/methodology/approach: This longitudinal study employed a one-group pretest-posttest experimental research design. A self-reported questionnaire was administered to a randomly selected sample of 250 National Diploma students from five polytechnics in the North Central part of Nigeria before and after they were exposed to EE. To achieve the objectives of this study, repeated-measures t-test and partial least squares structural equation modelling were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and SmartPLS, respectively, for data analysis. Findings: The results of the paired-samples t-test showed that students’ ATB, SN, PBC and EIs increased significantly after their exposure to EE. Also, further data analysis revealed that EE had a significantly positive relationship with students’ ATB, SN, PBC and EIs. Similarly, the results of the structural model indicated that ATB had a significantly positive link with students’ EIs and also mediated the relationship between EE and students’ EIs. SN and PBC had a positive but not statistically significant relationship with students’ EIs and did not mediate the relationship between EE and students’ EIs. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide interesting implications for EE and entrepreneurship policies in Nigeria. More specifically, the findings provide some practical implications for the Nigerian government and the EE curriculum developers. To achieve greater impact of EE on students’ EIs at the tertiary education level, the Nigerian government should incorporate EE into the curricula at the primary and secondary education levels. Equipping students at the primary and secondary education levels with entrepreneurial knowledge, competencies and skills would enable them to develop a strong entrepreneurial mindset even before they gain admission to tertiary institutions. Originality/value: It is one of the few studies that have tested empirically both the direct and the indirect effects of EE on students’ EIs in a single study. Thus, it helps to further clarify the links between EE and EIs. Besides, it is among the first studies to adopt a longitudinal approach to assess the effects of EE on students’ EIs through the constructs of the TPB (i.e. ATB, SN and PBC) in the Nigerian context. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Attitudes towards behaviour; Entrepreneurial intentions; Entrepreneurship education; Longitudinal approach; Subjective norms; Theory of planned behaviour",""

Defined as “new ideas that have the potential to improve either the quality or the quantity of life,” social innovation stands in stark contrast to business innovation that focuses on creativity with the intention of making a profit. Drawing on research on motivation, creativity, rentier mentality, and Islamic work ethics, this article takes a motivational approach to social innovation and advances a proposition that prosocial motivation is of particular importance in fostering social innovation in the context of the UAE. We argue that due to policies that grant nationals high financial stability and affluence, UAE locals are less likely to be driven by extrinsic motivation, but rather by intrinsic motivation. We propose that enhancing their prosocial motivation will have a synergetic effect with their intrinsic motivation and therefore lead to higher social innovation. This article extends the literature on prosocial motivation, social innovation, and social entrepreneurship by identifying a geographical/cultural region where the motivational basis for social innovation is amplified. Significantly, this article questions common assumptions about a rentier mentality and proposes a path to leverage social innovation.

The literature on entrepreneurship has recognized that Entrepreneurship Education (EE) plays a key role in this process, but the literature on academic spinoffs has focused on other determinants (e.g., Technology Transfer Offices - TTO, and university research expenditures). This research investigates the role of EE in the creation of academic spinoffs by using a new dataset built around 1262 entrepreneurship courses offered between 2011 and 2014 by 80 US universities included in the Licensing Survey by the Association of University Technology Managers - AUTM). Adopting a Poisson panel regression model, we show that, in addition to TTO size and university research expenditures, EE favours the creation of academic spinoffs. Moreover, we find that practical – rather than theoretical - entrepreneurship courses favour the creation of academic spinoffs.

Data were collected through a questionnaire survey of full-time non-managerial employees selected, from different departments of various four- and five-star hotels across five economically and culturally different societies (UK, UAE, Germany, China, USA). Our results indicated that both institutional pressures and corporate support have positive influence on employees’ innovative behaviour. Furthermore, Hotels in cultures with high levels of individualism and low levels of uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity will indicate higher levels of innovative behaviour in response to corporate support programs. While, hotels in nations with high levels of power distance, collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity will indicate higher levels of innovative behaviour in response to normative, mimetic, and coercive pressure. These findings provide important implications for innovative behaviour by developing and validating a multilevel model empirically in the hospitality context. © 2020","corporate support programs; Cross-Cultural Study; Employees’ innovative behaviour; institutional pressures",""

I propose that in underdeveloped institutional environments, a regional government which is able to perform its core function of delivering public and social services is positively associated with the growth of opportunity entrepreneurship. This effect becomes stronger in regions with more market-based economies, higher education institutions (HEIs), an entrepreneurial culture, and social entrepreneurship. Empirical results based on entrepreneurship data at the provincial level in China between 1993 and 2013 provide strong support for the hypotheses. This study contributes to the literature on EE by providing more systematic evidence from underdeveloped institutional environments, and has policy implications for promoting opportunity entrepreneurship. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Entrepreneurial culture; Entrepreneurial ecosystems; HEIs; Market development; Opportunity entrepreneurship; Regional governments; Social entrepreneurship","Commerce; Ecosystems; Core functions; Entrepreneurial cultures; Entrepreneurial ecosystem; Higher education institutions; Key elements; Market development; Opportunity entrepreneurship; Regional government; Regional opportunities; Social entrepreneurship; Public policy"
